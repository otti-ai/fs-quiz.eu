			My name is Yannik Ottens and I study computer science at the University of Bremen in Germany. I am part of Formula Student Austria and 
			between 2016-2023 I was a member of Bremergy the Formula Student Team from Bremen, Germany. Over the last years I have created an extensive 
			archive of quizzes and since my time at Bremergy has come to an end, I and the team have decided to make this data available to all teams. 
			This page therefore contains the collected data and offers the possibility to train with it. More about this page in the <a href="/faq">FAQ.</a></p>
